# Title: npm-publish.yml
#
# Description:
# This script is designed to publish Unity packages to the GitLab npm package registry.
# It is used in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
# It consists of four main stages:
#     1. fetch: Fetch the CI scripts from the ci-scripts repository.
#     2. prepare: Prepare the package for publishing.
#     3. update: Update the changelog based on the new version number.
#     4. release: Publish the package to the GitLab npm package registry.
#
# Features:
#     - Copies necessary files for Unity custom packages, README.md, and CHANGELOG.md to create a distribution directory.
#     - Automatically updates the version based on the versionBumpHint in package.json.
#     - Automatically increments the version by comparing it with the already published version in the npm registry.
#     - Publishes the package to the GitLab npm package registry.
#     - Tags the commit with the new version number.

stages:
  - fetch
  - prepare
  - update
  - release
