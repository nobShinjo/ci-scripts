# Title: npm-publish.yml

# Description:
# This script is designed to publish Unity packages to the GitLab npm package registry.
# It is used in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
# It consists of three main stages:
#     1. prepare: Prepare the package
#     2. check: Check the version
#     3. publish: Publish the package
#
# Features:
#     - Copies necessary files for Unity custom packages, README.md, and CHANGELOG.md to create a distribution directory.
#     - Automatically updates the version based on the versionBumpHint in package.json.
#     - Automatically increments the version by comparing it with the already published version in the npm registry.
#     - Publishes the package to the GitLab npm package registry.
#     - Tags the commit with the new version number.

stages:
  - prepare
  - check
  - publish
