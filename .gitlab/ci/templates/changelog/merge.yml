# Title: changelog/merge.yml
#
# Description:
# This script is designed to merge a changelog draft into CHANGELOG.md.
# It is used in a GitLab CI/CD pipeline.
# It consists of one main stage:
#     1. merge: Merge the changelog draft into CHANGELOG.md.
#
# Features:
#     - Merges the draft changelog into CHANGELOG.md.
#     - Commits and pushes the updated CHANGELOG.md to the current branch.
#     - Runs only if the draft changelog exists and the pipeline is triggered by a merge request event.
#     - Can be manually triggered for other branches.
