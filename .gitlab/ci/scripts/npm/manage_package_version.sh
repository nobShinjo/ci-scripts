# Title: npm/manage_package_version.sh
#
# Description:
#   This script manages the versioning of a package in a package.json file.
#   It checks if the package is published in a GitLab registry and compares the local version with the published version.
#   If the package is published with the same version, it bumps the version based on the provided versionBumpHint.
#   If the package is not published, it uses the local version.
#   If the local version is older than the published version, it aborts the publish to avoid version conflicts.
#   If the local version is newer than the published version, it updates the package.json with the local version.

# set -euo pipefail: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
